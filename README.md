# BOZO SORT (A little worse)

This is a normal bozo sort algorithm for sorting an array.
### here are main disadvantags:
1. It is slow as "", takes forever (literally) to sort a 15 element array(list).
2. Variable names are long. Seems like you are reading english laguage.
3. To make thing extra bad **while swithching two random element it is not checked if they are at same position**.

Thanks.
